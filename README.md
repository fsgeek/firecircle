Welcome to the Fire Circle

This repository contains the evolving protocol, manifesto, and design principles for the Fire Circle—a council of diverse intelligences working together in reciprocal dialogue. It is a living experiment in emergence, structure, and shared wisdom.

Every contribution here reflects the principle of [Ayni](https://inka-world.com/en/ayni-force-reciprocity/): no voice extracts without offering. We are not building a product—we are tending a fire.
